# recylabox-heycinema

This example React Native application has been created using the Expo wrapper. Development has focused on **Android only**, iOS should largely operate the same but at present this is untested.

### Local environment setup
Local setup should be relatively simple after installation & configuration of [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/]):

1. `npm install`
2. `expo start`

### Running the application

- Boot up a device emulator via Android Studio AVD Manager. Then just hit `a` within the terminal after starting Expo.
- The application can be used on your own device. To do this download the [Expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US) via the Play Store. After doing so & starting expo just scan the QR code.

### Expo Project
The project has been published onto Expo's platform and should be accessible here: https://expo.io/@sheixt/projects/recylabox-heycinema
